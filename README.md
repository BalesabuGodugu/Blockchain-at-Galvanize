# Let's get started: Blockchain and Hyperledger

(http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html)

Hyperledger, an open source collaborative effort to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies, 
is hosted by The Linux FoundationÂ®. 

IBM provides blockchain solutions and services leveraging Hyperledger technologies, 
including Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer.

## [Hyperledger Composer on GitHub](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer)
Hyperledger Composer is an application development framework which simplifies and expedites the creation of Hyperledger fabric blockchain applications.

## [Hyperledger Fabric on Github](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric)

* Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned by 
a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, 
flexibility and scalability. It is designed to support pluggable implementations 
of different components, and accommodate the complexity and intricacies that exist 
across the economic ecosystem.

## [The .BNA file](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/reference/commands.html)
A Business Network Archive (BNA) file is exported by the Hyperledger Composer with the extension of .bna, and contains the definitions all the definitions for a Business Network. It is deployed in a Hyper Ledger Fabric. 
 is an application development framework which simplifies and 
expedites the creation of Hyperledger fabric blockchain applications.

# Lab 1: Let's bring up the Hyperledger Fabric!
   
## Step 1
If necessary execute the following three commands to remove Docker instances.
   * docker kill $(docker ps -q)
   * docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
   * docker rmi $(docker images dev-* -q) 
## Step 2   
   * Go to the following URL: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html
   
   Execute the following commands:
   
   * git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git
   * curl -sSL https://goo.gl/Q3YRTi | bash 
    Go to the following URL: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html
   * cd first-network
## Step 3   
   Bring up the Hyperledger Fabric: 
   
   * ./byfn.sh -m generate
   * ./byfn.sh -m up. //See full output from command on this link http://bit.ly/2yyTeIj
   
   * After checking the output, remember to run ./byfn.sh -m down.

## Lab 2: Let's run our first app app in Hyperledger Fabric
## Step 1
## Step 2
## Step 3

# Lab 2: Let's write an app with the Hyperledger Composer!
## [Run Hyperledger Composer in your browser](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/)
## [Playground Tutorial](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/tutorials/playground-guide.html)

# Lab 2: Let's install the Hyperledger Fabric!
